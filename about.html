								Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Connor Geshan and I am a first year mechanical engineering master's student
								at Carnegie Mellon University. I have interests in automation, engineering design, making, and tinkering both inside and outside 
								of the classroom. I enjoy collaborating with other passionate engineers to solve complex real-world problems and improve people's quality
								of life through various engineered solutions. Academically I am fascinated with computer vision, machine learning, as well as space and
								humanoid robitics. I have molded my graduate coursework around these passions and am eager to develop solutions throughout my professional
								career. <br><br><br>

									My personal interests include making, ice hockey, golf, and anything to do with my dog Dakota. I played four years of NCAA Division III 
									ice hockey during my undergraduate years at Western New England University. Since graduating I have re-ignited my passion for golf and 
									am always looking to play a round in my free time. Besides sports, I enjoy making and hands on building, please see some of the things I 
									have built on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page! Dakota, my labradoodle, and I enjoy playing fetch and going on long hikes. A 
									final fun fact about me, I was cast as Prince Charming in my highschools production of Rodger and Hammerstein's Cinderella.
