										<td>Introduction</td>
										<td>This course project taught me the importance of designing a product to suit the 
											needs of a target audience. I proposed the idea for this group project because I 
											have both friends and family who are educators. We conducted interviews to assess their 
											needs for the product, and got their feedback on initial prototypes. 
											<br><br> My roles on this project were:
											<ul class="custom-indent">
												<li>Evaluating user needs and feedback</li>
												<li>Handwriting to text functionality, via OCR</li>
											</ul>
											This project taught me more about group coding, and adapting 'off the shelf' OCR models to suit our needs. 
											The most valuable things I learned were about tailoring a product to meet specific customer needs, rather than
											my idea of their needs. Obtaining user feedback and altering the prototype based on this feedback was a pivotal learning
											opportunity. <br><br> More details about the project is below.

										<td>Motivation</td>
										<td>Great strides are now being made in the world of 
											artificial intelligence toward the automation of 
											tedious tasks, reducing human workloads across a 
											ariety of fields and industries. The workload of 
											our educators is one that desperately needs a 
											reduction, as they are overworked and understaffed. 
											We interviewed several schoolteachers to gather data 
											on their preferences, and conceptualized various 
											solutions to the problem. As such, in this work we 
											plan to develop a user-friendly intelligent tool that 
											reduces the workload of teachers.  Our tool’s chosen 
											concept involves the use of natural language processing 
											to grade short form answer assignments.

										<td>Methods</td>
										<td>We offer a fun and interactive game as a way to teach children these 
											important typing skills. Our game will feature the following major 
											components:<br>
											<ol>
												<li>Design Process:
													<ul>
														During the design process of our product, we 
														made many changes to improve its accuracy, 
														reliability and ease of use. We created three 
														prototypes, each with improvements and changes 
														made based on testing and feedback.
														
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Handwriting to text functionality:
													<ul>
														The first part of our pipeline was our Handwriting 
														to Text function. We attempted two methods: Object 
														Detection and the pre-trained TrOCR model. The Object 
														Detection method was not robust enough for sentences or 
														multi-word answers, while the TrOCR model resulted in 
														nearly perfect accuracy. The TrOCR model was trained 
														using the IAM handwriting dataset and was able to 
														properly convert entire sentences from handwriting to 
														text.

													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>OpenCV implementation:
													<ul>
														For the third round of prototyping, we implemented a 
														requirement for single-line responses for demonstration 
														urposes. We utilized the OpenCV library to extract 
														handwritten answers from the submitted documents. This 
														method is currently limited in that it only applies 
														to a very specific format with five answers.

													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>GUI design:
													<ul>
														We built our GUI in Streamlit and implemented a multi-page 
														format. The user can advance to the next stage of the process 
														after certain quotas are filled, at which point the "Continue"
														button becomes available. There is also a "reset" button in 
														case the user decides to start over from the beginning. The app 
														first asks the user to input the number of questions they are 
														grading, after which the app presents a number of text input 
														boxes equivalent to the number of questions given by the user, 
														into which the user enters the correct answers for the assignment.

													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Evaluation function:
													<ul>
														Our evaluation function uses Sent2Vec, a Python NLP library 
														for sentence embedding. Sent2Vec uses a trained DistilBERT 
														Base language model and the Word2Vec method to encode sentences 
														into vectors of words. Sent2Vec sums the word vectors for each 
														sentence to obtain a vectorization of the complete sentence. From 
														there, the semantic similarity between two sentence vectors can 
														then be calculated using cosine similarity. Our solution compares 
														the "semantic distance" between the correct answer provided by the 
														teacher and each student's answer. This "distance" value was 
														converted into a grade using a manually-tuned gain. The score is 
														then clipped to prevent negative scores from occurring.

													</ul>
												</li>

										<td>Results</td>
										<td> Our machine learning pipeline for grading short answer questions was successfully 
											developed and tested through multiple prototypes. We were able to achieve high 
											accuracy in converting handwriting to text using the pre-trained TrOCR model, which 
											resulted in a nearly perfect accuracy for our purposes. We also tested the robustness 
											of the model by examining longer phrases and messier handwriting, and found that 
											snipping the answers line by line improved the model's accuracy. <br><br>

											The final version of our app successfully allowed teachers to upload a CSV file 
											containing their answer key, eliminating the need to type in the answers again 
											after every reset. The app also allowed teachers to upload a ZIP file containing the 
											class’ scanned assignments as individual PDFs, which were segmented and converted 
											to text format using OCR. <br><br>
											
											Our evaluation function successfully compared the “semantic distance” between the 
											correct answer provided by the teacher and each student’s answer, and converted the 
											“distance” value into a grade using a manually tuned gain. The grade was then clipped 
											to prevent negative scores from occurring. We tested the app on a sample dataset of 
											short answer questions from a high school history exam, and found that the app was 
											able to accurately grade each student's answer within minutes.<br><br>
											
											Overall, our intelligent tool successfully reduced the workload of teachers 
											by automating the grading of short answer questions, saving teachers hours each 
											week in grading. This tool has the potential to revolutionize the field of education 
											by allowing teachers to focus on more important tasks, such as lesson planning and 
											providing individualized support to students.

										<td>Final Thoughts</td>
										<td>The development of our intelligent tool that automates the grading of short answer 
											questions is a significant step towards easing the workload of educators, who are 
											often overworked and understaffed. The results of our product, which enables
											teachers to upload pictures of their students' short answer questions and receive 
											a grade in minutes, are promising. Our machine learning pipeline can read each 
											student’s picture, convert the handwriting to text, and then grade each answer 
											by comparing it to the answer key that the teacher uploaded. Our product can automatically 
											analyze an entire class’s homework and then present a list of the student’s name and 
											their grade, thus saving teachers hours each week in grading.<br><br>
